# homework2

This is a personal project where I build a website to demonstrate myself. 
In the website, there are three pages.

The main page, also the landing page, is my self-introduction. I explained why I have been drawing to Software Developer field and this bootcamp.

The other page I have, is my portfolio page. In this page, I listed all my projects. 

The last page I have is a contact me page, where viewers on the website can leave a message for me.
